Tencent Games, a leading Chinese game developer and publisher, has been making significant strides in expanding its global market share. While China remains the largest gaming market for Tencent, the company has been actively pursuing international growth and aims to have half of its players overseas [1]. However, as of 2020, only 21% of Tencent's total games revenue came from outside China [1]. 

Tencent's revenue from its gaming business has been on the rise. In the first quarter of 2023, Tencent's operating revenue increased by 11% to CNY48.3 billion (USD6.8 billion) compared to the same period last year [2]. The company's domestic revenue rose by 6.4% to CNY35.1 billion, marking the first growth since the same period in 2022 [2]. Additionally, Tencent's overseas revenue saw a record increase of 25% to CNY13.2 billion [2]. 

In terms of market dominance, Tencent and NetEase, another major Chinese game developer, accounted for more than 80% of the revenue generated by China's top ten gaming companies in the first quarter of 2023 [3]. Tencent alone accounted for roughly 50% of the domestic market revenue for the quarter [3]. NetEase's operating revenue from games also saw a 7.6% year-on-year increase, reaching 20.1 billion yuan [3].

Tencent's success can be attributed to its popular games such as Honor of Kings, Call of Duty Mobile, Moonlight Blade Mobile, Valorant, and Clash of Clans [4]. These games have been driving the company's growth both in the Chinese and international markets [4]. PUBG and Honor of Kings are also among the top-grossing games worldwide [4].

While Tencent continues to focus on mobile gaming, it recognizes the potential for growth in the PC and console market, which is worth over $70 billion outside China [1]. The company is incubating internal teams to develop cross-platform and AAA titles, and it is also looking to invest in game companies that already have expertise in these areas [1].

In conclusion, Tencent Games has been steadily expanding its global market share, with a focus on increasing its player base outside of China. The company's revenue from its gaming business has been growing, and it remains a dominant player in the Chinese gaming market. With popular games and strategic investments, Tencent is well-positioned to continue its global gaming domination [1].
